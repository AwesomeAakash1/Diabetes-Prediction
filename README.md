# Pima Indians Diabetes Detection- Machine Learning Project
This repository contains Python code that performs data analysis and machine learning modeling on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The code utilizes various data preprocessing techniques, visualization libraries, and machine learning algorithms to gain insights from the dataset and predict diabetes outcomes.

## Overview
The provided Python code performs the following tasks:

**Imports**: Import necessary libraries and modules for data processing, visualization, and machine learning modeling.

**Data Loading and Preview**: Loads the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset using the pandas library and provides an initial preview of the dataset's structure.

**Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values in the dataset by replacing them with appropriate values (e.g., mean and median).

**Data Visualization**: Uses seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations that help explore relationships between different variables, understand distributions, and identify potential patterns.

**Feature Engineering**: Detects and removes outliers using the Tukey method to improve model performance.

**Modeling**: Applies machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier. The models are evaluated using cross-validation to detect potential overfitting.

**Model Evaluatio**n: Evaluates and compares the models using cross-validation scores and identifies the model with the highest accuracy.
